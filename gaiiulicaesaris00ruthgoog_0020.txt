Tha Roman Empire iu Gaul was confined within
the boundaries of the Province till the time of

Caesar. Ostha state of the reatos Gaul Caesar ¹
tells usa great deal, and we learn more from other ”

lsources. The term Gallia included much more than
France does now, All the country west of the
Rhene went by the general name of Gallia. It was
split up into three well-marked divisione, or aggre· -’
gates of tribes—Gallia Celtica, Gallia Belgica, and '
Aquitania. Gallia Celtica, sometimes simply called
Gallia, was bounded cn the south by the Roman
Province and the Garonne (Garumna), aud extended
northwards to the Marna (Matrona) and the Seiae
(Sequana). From the Atlantia and English Obannel
in the west and north-west, it swept eastward tc
the sources of the Rhine and the Danube. The
portion ef Gaul which remained to the north-east
was Gallia Belgica, occupied by the Belgae, the
brevest people of all Gaul. The portion towards
the south, lying between the Garonne, the Pyrenees,
and the Ocean, was. Aquitania. Caesar plainly .
states that these three peoples were distinguished
from one another by language‚ custmns, and laws
(linqua, institutis, lacubus). It is almost certain
that the Aquitani were akin to the population of
Spain, but it is less easy tc determine in what
respect the Belgae differed from the Celtic Gauls.
They were probably of a Cymric stoek, not un-
mixed with German blood. In other words, they
were near kinsmen ol the Celtae, the two peoples .
standing in the same relation to one another as the
Welsh, a Oymric racc, stand to the Gaels of tho
Scottish Highlands.¹

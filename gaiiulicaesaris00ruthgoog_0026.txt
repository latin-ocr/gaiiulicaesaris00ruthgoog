THE ROMAN ARMY.

Tun Romans were a nation of soldiers, auditis
necessary to know something about the Roman
army in order to understand the writings of the
greatest Roman general. Every one knows how
Rome was not built without bloodshed; and it was s
by fire and sword, by blood and 11011, that she
pushed forward year by year the boundaries of
her empire. But, except 111 point of discipline,
the legions of Caesar bore little resemblance to
the citizen host which Romulus had led to vietoryo
seven centurias before. The history of the Roman Ἴ
Army divides itself into periods‚ but it is impossible
to understand accurately the military terms of a
later period without knowing something of those
which preceded, ιε
We will give a slight outline of the military
systems previous to that which was in use when
Caesar fou ght 111 Gaul. In the time of the kings
the order of battle was the phalanx, 1n which the
so ldgiinmers formed one compact mass. Camillus, at thero
nof the fourth century n..,o is said to have
’ brokpmnn aphalanx up into smaller bodies, called
anomali, capable of aoting separately, bnt trained
to act 1n concert. The whole legion was arranged
in three lines. Tha first line was composed of the2 2⁵

Iu preparing this edition 01 the Second and Third

Campeigns 01 0000010 Gallio War‚1 have received ’

much assistance from the editions 01 Schneider,
Deberem, end Kraner end Dittenberger. Schneider
s 10 inveluable to every editor of Caesen sud when·
ever the text 01 this edition differs from his, it is „
still generally based upon the information supplied
by his critical notes I have 0100 consulted Herzog,
Frigell, Long, Moberly, and Rheinha'rd. The ‘Del-
phin Oeesar' contains 0 complete and useful Index
Verborum. From Krener I heve borrowed the idea
- 01 0 short introduction on the Romen Army. The

extrects from Suetonius will help the student to ’

I have got some 11001111 hints from the ‘Jules
Gdsar' of the Emperor Nepoleon 111, und hove
found Alb. v. Kampen’s ‘Descriptiones Nobilissi-
morum opud· Olassicos Locorum’ ,0 very 11001111,Ι
series. But it is surprising thet the true exple· ¹

Aisne 1100 escaped previous editors.

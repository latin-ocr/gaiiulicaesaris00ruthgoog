steel over the shoulders and round the waiet. The

greaves (ocreae) reached to the knee or above it,

and were commonly of bronze. It soon became

customary to wear only one, the left leg being
'sseldom exposed by a swerdsman covered with a
· shield.

'I'he offensive armour consisted of two weapons.
One was the short, straight, two-edged Spanish
swerd (gladios Hispanus), adapted for stabbiug-

ιο rather than for cutting. It hung by a leather belt

(balteos)overtbeshoulder,orfromagirdle(oin9alom).

Privato soldiers wore the swerd on the right side,

, in order that the shield‚ which was carried on the

left arm, might not prevent its being easily drawn.

1⁵ Officers, who carried no shields‚ carried the swerd,

as is now done, on the left side. Each of the H'riarii

’ carried the long pike (boeto), which had originally

been confined to the Hastatl. The Hastati and the

Principes carried the pilum. The pilum was only

20 used as a missile, and consisted of a wooden shat't

about one and a half inch thick and fodr and a half

feet long. The iron part of the weapon was as long

aethe wood, but since it came down over the shaft

the whole measured about six and three-quarter feet-

25 iu length. Soft iren was used in its construction,

that by bending in the shield or other armour of

Ι the enemy it might hamper his moraments, and
when pulled out become unservioeable.

'I'he cavalry wore an iron cuirass,a helmet, and

30 leather legging's. They carried a serviceable shield,
a heavy lance, and a long sword.

Such were the formation and equipment of the
Roman Army till the time of Marius, about 100 uo.

- THE REFORMS OF MARIUS. xxiii

into larger bodies, called cohortes, each- cohort
containing six centurias or three maniples-one
maniple of Hastati, one of Principes, and one of
Triarii. Moreover, the hasta was transferred from
ῒΙιθἱ Hastati to the Triarii; and at one time the s
Triarii must have carried the pilum when the other

two lines were armed with the hesta. For the two
first lines are occasionally designated cotcpihrai ; and
the first centurion of the legion, who was also the
first of the Triarii, was called primipilm, or primi ιο
pili centorio, a name which he always retained.

, The military period into which ansar’s campaigns
fall began with the reforms of Marius. The lower
classes of the Roman populace, who had hitherto
been excluded from service, were now made elig'ibla ιε
anderen freedmen (libertini) were admitted to the
legions. The division into Hastati, Principes, and
Triarii entirely disappeared. The pilum became
the common weapon of all legionarios. The echert
displaoed the maniplo as thebaeis of the military φο
formation. As a result of the Social War (ot-89 ao.)
the Socii Italici became Roman· citizens, and from
that date the distinction between leyioo'ea and Socii
was dropped. A Roman Army now consisted of
Romans and auxiliary troops. There were no 2⁵
Velites. All legionary soldiers were milites pravis
armaturae. In Caesar's army all light troops
(milites levis armaturae) are auxiliarios. Such were
the slingers (traditores), who shot stones (lapides)
or lead bullets (piandos), and the archers (sagittarii). 30
They came principally from Orate and the Balearic
islanda. The cavalry consisted wholly of foreign
troops-Gauls, Germane, Spaniards. Some were
attached to the legions in the old fashion. The
rest formed an arm distinct from the legion. Hence ³⁵
